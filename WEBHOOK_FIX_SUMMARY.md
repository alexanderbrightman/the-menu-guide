# Webhook Handler Bug Fix Summary

## Problem

Users' accounts were not being updated with premium features after successful Stripe payments. The payment processed correctly, but the subscription status remained on the free tier.

## Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed several issues:

1. **Missing Database Schema**: The `profiles` table was missing Stripe-related columns (`stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `subscription_current_period_end`, etc.) that the webhook code was trying to update.

2. **Incomplete Event Handling**: The webhook handler had logic gaps in processing different event types, particularly for `invoice.payment_succeeded` which was only logging and not updating the database.

3. **No Idempotency**: The webhook had no protection against processing the same event multiple times, which could lead to duplicate updates or race conditions.

4. **Insufficient Logging**: Error messages were not detailed enough to debug webhook processing issues.

5. **Missing Error Handling**: Some edge cases were not properly handled, such as missing metadata or failed database updates.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update

Created `database/add_stripe_columns.sql` migration to add missing columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_customer_id text,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_subscription_id text,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_current_period_end timestamp with time zone,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_cancel_at_period_end boolean DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subscription_canceled_at timestamp with time zone;
```

**Why this matters**: Without these columns, the webhook couldn't save Stripe customer/subscription data to the database, preventing proper subscription management.

### 2. Improved Webhook Handler

Updated `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` with the following improvements:

#### Idempotency Protection

```typescript
const processedEvents = new Map<string, number>()

// Check if event already processed
if (processedEvents.has(eventId)) {
  console.log(`Event ${eventId} already processed, skipping`)
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true, skipped: true })
}
```

**Why this matters**: Prevents duplicate processing if Stripe retries a webhook or if the same event is received multiple times.

#### Better Event Handling

- Extracted event handlers into separate functions for better organization
- Improved `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted` to validate all required data
- Enhanced `handleInvoicePaymentSucceeded` to actually process payment events
- Better error messages with prefixed log tags like `[Webhook]`, `[Checkout]`, etc.

**Why this matters**: Makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug. Also ensures all relevant events properly update the database.

#### Improved Logging

Added structured logging with prefixes:

```typescript
console.log('[Checkout] Session completed:', {
  id: checkoutSession.id,
  mode: checkoutSession.mode,
  paymentStatus: checkoutSession.payment_status,
  // ...
})
```

**Why this matters**: Makes it easier to track webhook processing in production logs and identify issues quickly.

#### Better Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  // Process event
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`[Webhook] Error handling event ${event.type}:`, error)
  // Remove from processed events on error so it can be retried
  processedEvents.delete(eventId)
  return new NextResponse(`Webhook handler failed: ${error}`, { status: 400 })
}
```

**Why this matters**: Ensures failed webhooks can be retried, and provides proper error responses to Stripe.

### 3. Testing Documentation

Created `WEBHOOK_TESTING.md` with comprehensive testing instructions:

- How to set up Stripe CLI for local testing
- How to test the payment flow end-to-end
- How to verify database updates
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- Best practices for production

**Why this matters**: Ensures developers can test webhook functionality before deploying to production.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
psql $DATABASE_URL < database/add_stripe_columns.sql
```

Or run the SQL directly in the Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Webhook Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix webhook handler for subscription updates"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Webhook Configuration

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Verify your webhook endpoint is configured for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. Verify the webhook URL is pointing to your production domain (not localhost)

### Step 4: Test the Payment Flow

1. Create a test user
2. Initiate payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Check database to verify subscription was created:

```sql
SELECT 
  subscription_status,
  is_public,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'your_user_id';
```

Expected results:
- `subscription_status` = `'pro'`
- `is_public` = `true`
- Both IDs are populated

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start development server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Forward webhooks
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# Terminal 3: Trigger test event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### Production Testing

1. Make a test payment with Stripe test card
2. Check application logs for webhook events
3. Verify database was updated correctly
4. Test that user can access premium features

## Security Improvements

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**: Already implemented - ensures events are from Stripe
2. **Admin Client**: Webhook uses Supabase service role key for bypassing RLS
3. **Data Validation**: All incoming data is validated before processing
4. **Error Logging**: Errors are logged without exposing sensitive data

## Performance Considerations

- **Idempotency Map**: In-memory storage is fine for single-instance deployments
- **Production Note**: For multi-instance deployments (e.g., Vercel), consider using Redis or a database table for idempotency tracking
- **Cleanup Job**: Old event IDs are cleaned up every hour to prevent memory leaks

## Future Improvements

1. **Database-based Idempotency**: Use a database table to track processed events instead of in-memory map
2. **Webhook Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff for failed webhooks
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a dashboard to monitor webhook success rates
4. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for failed webhook deliveries
5. **Automated Tests**: Add integration tests to CI/CD pipeline
